# SPZ-HUD-for-FiveM
This repository is a fork of the Qbox HUD (Qbx_HUD) project, featuring a fully redesigned frontend for a next-generation user interface. The HUD has been reimagined with a focus on enhancing both aesthetics and functionality, ensuring a more immersive and modern experience for users.

Key Improvements:
Fuel Gauge Revamp: Redesigned with smooth rotational alignment and real-time percentage display for clarity.
Enhanced UI/UX: Minimalistic, professional design with optimized responsiveness and accessibility.
Customizable Elements: Refined styles tailored for roleplay setups, seamlessly integrated with the original Qbox backend.
Forward Compatibility: Polished frontend updates without disrupting existing functionalities.
This project bridges functionality and visual excellence, setting a new standard for gaming and roleplay HUDs.
